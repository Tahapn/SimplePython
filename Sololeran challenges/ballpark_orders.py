# you will order a Coke for them instead. 
 
# Input Format

# Output Format  
# You will output a number of the total cost of the food and drinks. 
 
# Sample Input  
# 'Pizza Cheeseburger Water Popcorn' 
 
# Sample Output  
# 26.75


#### solution #### 
foods = input()
price = {"Water":4,"Coke":5,"Cheeseburger":10,"Nachos":6,"Pizza":6}
foods = foods.split(" ")
total = 0
for food in foods :

    # if the food is not in the dictionary it will return 5 because that's the price of Coke.
    # we are suposed to buy them coke if they  order something that's not in the menu

    total += price.get(food,5)
    
print(total  + total * 0.07)
